# WeatherBot
This telegram bot was created as the final project for the introduction to engineering .

Sometimes it happens that you are going somewhere and you urgently need to find out the weather forecast, but you don't have time to type a query into a search engine and look for a reliable source.

And sometimes it happens that you correspond in a telegram with a loved one who is in another city, in another country, in another corner of the world and you wonder what the weather is like there. And with the help of our bot, you can quickly find out the weather conditions anywhere in the world.

When you launch our bot, the message "Hello! Write me the name of the city and I'll send you a weather report!" , then after you have written the desired city, he sends you a weather forecast and a couple of feedbacks from our developers. If you enter the wrong city, the bot will ask you to make sure that the spelling is correct.
